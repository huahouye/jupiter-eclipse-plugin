Jupiter is a code review plug-in tool for the Eclipse IDE. It is currently under active development, and still in an experimental state. The design of Jupiter involves the following:

  * Open Source: Jupiter carries an open source license.
  * Free: Jupiter is distributed free of charge.
  * IDE integration: Jupiter is based upon the Eclipse plug-in architecture.
  * Cross-platform: Jupiter is available for all platforms supported by Eclipse.
  * XML data storage: Jupiter stores data in XML format to simplify use and re-use.
  * Sorting and searching: Jupiter provides filters and sorting to facilitate issue review.
  * File integration: Jupiter supports jumping back and forth between reviews and source code.

Please note that Jupiter will be moving here after Eclipse 3.3 is released.  The version(s) here will support only Eclipse 3.3 and beyond.  To get Jupiter for Eclipse 3.2.x please download Jupiter 3.2.1 at http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/files/edu.hawaii.ics.csdl.jupiter_3.2.1.jar.

With this new and exciting move for Jupiter we are also announcing that Jupiter will no longer support Java 1.4.  Jupiter will be using Java 5.  If you still need Java 1.4 support please download Jupiter 3.2.1 from http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/files/edu.hawaii.ics.csdl.jupiter_3.2.1.jar.  Jupiter is tested against Java 5 and Java 6.  Plans for Java 7 are not yet in place.
