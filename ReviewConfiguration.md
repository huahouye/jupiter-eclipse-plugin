# Review ID Configuration Defaults #
For teams that perform many reviews, it can become tiresome to configure a review ID from scratch each time.  To simplify this process, Jupiter provides a "Master" review ID that is stored in the property.xml file in the Jupiter plugin directory.  The settings stored in this DEFAULT review ID for reviewer names, issue types, the review file directory, and so forth become the default values when creating regular review IDs.  Thus, by configuring the special DEFAULT review ID, you can provide values to be used each time you create a normal review ID.

Note that each project has a different DEFAULT review ID (see below), and that the DEFAULT review ID can not deleted from the review ID list.

# Configuration Phase #
The main purpose in this phase is to define a new review.   You specify the review ID for a set of reviewing files, a set of reviewers, the author of the review session (ID), a review file storage, item entries, default items, and filters.

  * Review Files - Specifies the files to be reviewed by reviewers. By specifying a set of review files, you help focus the review on a small part of the system.  These files are  listed in the jump icon in the table view.
  * Reviewers - Specifies the reviewers who examine the review files. The issues generated by each reviewer for a given review ID are stored in their own file.
  * Author - Specifies the author of this review. By default, the review Author is assigned to deal with all of the issues generated during this review.
  * Storage - Specifies the review storage directory for all of the files associated with this review ID.
  * Item Entries - Specifies the contents of an issue.  You can customize the set of Type, Severity, Resolution, and Status fields.
  * Default Items - Specifies the default values for fields when a new issue is created.
  * Filters - Specifies the filters to be applied when displaying issues.  This is particularly useful during the Team and Rework phases.

### Add a new review ID ###
To add a review ID, you can right click on a project name (the root icon name of each project ) in either "Package Explore" or "Navigator" view, then select "Properties" to show the property window associated with this Project.  Finally, select Jupiter to get the Property Window for Jupiter.

Click "New.." button to open new Review ID wizard. Fill Review ID and Description field respectively. It is recommended that Review ID is a non space word because this ID is used as a part of the review storage file name. Provide a short description of this review for the description field.

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ReviewId.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ReviewId.jpg)

The next step is to specify the files to be reviewed. These files will be listed in the jump button of the table view so that reviewers can easily navigate to the files of interest.  Click the "New..." button to open the Review File Selection dialog. Select a set of reviewing files and press "OK".

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ReviewFileSelection.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ReviewFileSelection.jpg)

Now you can see the set of reviewing files.

The next step is to specify the set of reviewers. These reviewers are used to create an individual review storage file. So the review issues entered by each reviewers are stored in each reviewer name based storage file. This setting is also used to show the selection list in the "Assigned To" field.

Click "Add..." button on the page to open "Add Reviewer" dialog. It is recommended that you also select a non space word for a reviewer ID. A simple approach is to use the user's account name.

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ReviewerId.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ReviewerId.jpg)

Add as many reviewers as required.  Note that the initial set of reviewers are copied from the DEFAULT  review ID during the initial creation of this review ID.

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ReviewerListSetting.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ReviewerListSetting.jpg)

The next step is to specify the author of this review ID. The author of this review ID is automatically the Assigned To person in the team phase.

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/AuthorSetting.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/AuthorSetting.jpg)

The next step is to specify the field values. You can customize the set of entries for each item field, and the order of the list. These items are listed in the review editor item selection. If you want to set them back to the default item entries, you can click the "Restore" button. The default values are copied from the DEFAULT review ID.

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ItemEntriesSetting.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/ItemEntriesSetting.jpg)

The next step is to specify the default item from the item entries list. This provides the default selection in each field when new issue is entered in the review editor view. For example, if you are adding review issues which relate to the violation which are described in Element of Java style, you can set the type as a default so that the type is set automatically in every new review issue entry.

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/DefaultItemsSetting.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/DefaultItemsSetting.jpg)

The next step is to specify the review storage file location. During review, each issue is stored in an XML file. This setting enables you to choose the location where these XML files will be stored. To customize the directory location, you can use "/" (forward slash) as file separator. For example, if you want to save xml files under the review/sample directory, you can type "review/sample".

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/StorageSetting.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/StorageSetting.jpg)

The next step is to specify the filter setting. Each phase has own filter so that you can use filter in different situation. In most case, you can customize the individual, team, or/and rework phase filter setting in order to let you organize team meeting efficiently. Here is an example for each phase:

  * Individual Phase
    * Reviewer filter (automatic) - Allows the reviewers to be able to see only their own review issues entered. This might help each reviewer not referring anyone's review and bring more review quality in team phase.
  * Team Phase
    * Resolution filter (unset) - Allows a moderator to just focus on the review issues whose resolution is unset. Any resolution except unset will be filtered after the resolution is changed during the team phase.
  * Rework Phase
    * Assigned to filter (automatic) - Allows the assigned persons (in most case, the author of the review ID) to be able to just focus on their review issues assigned.
    * Status filter (open) - Allows the assigned persons to just focus on the review issues whose status is open. Any status except open will be filtered after the status is changed during the rework phase.

![http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/FilterSetting.jpg](http://jupiter-eclipse-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/images/FilterSetting.jpg)

After all settings are done, click the "Finish" button. The ".jupiter" configuration file is created in the project root.

Finally, don't forget commit the ".jupiter" file to your configuration management system.  Now you can send out email to announce the review.

### Remove a review ID ###
To remove a review ID, you can select the removing review ID, and click the "Remove" button. Please note that deleting the review ID causes all related review files to be removed as well.

The following seven "controllerpackage1" related review file will be removed if the review ID were deleted.
